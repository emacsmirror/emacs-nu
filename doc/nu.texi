@chapter Overview

``Nu `` is a modern keybinding for Emacs.

nu-mode is a global minor mode, its keymap,
and the commands which are not provided in raw Emacs.

Modern, means respecting conventions like
@enumerate
@item @kbd{Control-f} to find
@item @kbd{Control-r} to replace
@item @kbd{Control-s} to save
@item @kbd{Control-x}, @kbd{Control-c}, @kbd{Control-v} to cut, copy, paste.
@end enumerate

To allow user to leverage large panel of functions, nu-mode relies on prompts. For example, @kbd{Control-f} raises a prompt precising which key - actually, which sequence - to press in order to execute desired function : once @kbd{Control-f} has been pressed and the ``Find-prompt'' appears, pressing @key{f} will start a regexp search, while @kbd{g} will execute goto-line, or @kbd{s} will move point to previous selection.

Inverse is sometimes true : since @kbd{Control+s} invoking a prompt would be irritating, this sequence directly saves buffer, while @kbd{Alt+s} runs the ``save prompt''.

nu-emacs does not only provides nu-mode. There are also two independant parts
@enumerate
@item nu-alias is a simple mechanism to define aliases into org-mode file(s). This way its easier to maintain aliases to be invoked from Mx. See its REAME.
@item dhammacakka is a light set of customization. See its README.
@end enumerate


@section Dependencies
Nu depends on several libraries, both native or external ones :
@enumerate
@item help-fns+
@item undo-tree
@item ace-jump
@item recentf
@item cua-selection-mode
@end enumerate


@section Help

Use @kbd{Control-q} to quit a sequence or a command in progress.
Use @kbd{Alt+z} to undo last command.
Use @kbd{Control+h} to gain access to help functions. This includes the usual shortcuts to describe what a key does, or what a function does.

Prompts are usually triggered using a @kbd{Control} modifier and advertise a function using the same key, but with @kbd{Alt} modifier. For example, @kbd{Control-f} will pop-up a find-prompt, while @kbd{Alt-f} will directly allow you to `ace-jump` to a char.

These prompts offer you to quickly learn where functions are.

@node NU for the power user
@chapter NU for the power user

If you are not used to Emacs, reading this chapter is not necessary. But Emacs veteran should probably start here.
emacs-nu redefines many keys, however two points make learning curve shorter

@enumerate
@item For any user, knowing CUA keybinds will make emacs-nu discoverable.
@item For veteran Emacs user, two important sequences remain:
@end enumerate

@kbd{M-x} is still there. This means, you can probably obtain what you want.
Also, @kbd{Control+h} for help-prefix is still there.

Now, three things should probably be kept in mind while trying nu-mode

@enumerate
@item
To repeat a command, use @kbd{Alt+Space}.
@item
To trigger a major mode sequence, start with @kbd{Control+Space}. This will invoke vanilla emacs @kbd{Control+c}. For example, into org-mode, use @kbd{Control+Space Control+n} to navigate to next node. If you already defined you own keys starting with @kbd{Control+c}, do not amend this definition.

@lisp
(define-key mykeymap kbd("\C-c h") myfunction)
@end lisp

To invoke above myfunction example, press @kbd{Control-SPC h}.

@item
You should not rely on @kbd{Control+x}, or at least no regularly. However to trigger x prefix, use @kbd{Control+Alt+Space}.

@end enumerate


Note that `where-is` function, which sometimes advertises shortcuts, will not really work, since a prompt is not a keymap : where is do not know how to invoke @kbd{Control-f} then @kbd{k} to reach end of buffer.

Two features make this drawback acceptable :
@enumerate
@item
From the help prompt (@kbd{Control-h}), run @key{h} to invoke nu-help. This function will present you all prompts, and will offer you to describe their keymaps - that is, all the functions you can access from these prompts.
@item
For each function accessible from a prompt, an additional shortcut is created, accessible from @kbd{menu} plus the same @kbd{key} than the prompt, in order to make where-is advertise. Hence, if you read `You can run this command with <menu> f k`, please understand, despite it is true, that you can run the command with @kbd{Control-f-k}.
@end enumerate

@node View and Edit
@chapter View and Edit


@section Navigate

While arrows still work, Nu uses @key{Alt} key to navigate.
Hence, the thumb often presses @key{Alt} key, while pinky finger remains safe.
Navigate up left right down using @key{Alt} and :


@w{    }I@*
@w{     }J@w{ }K@w{ }L


Additionally, use @key{Alt} @key{u} and @key{Alt} @key{o} to move to previous, next word.

@w{  }U@w{ }I@w{ }O@*
@w{     }J@w{ }K@w{ }L


Use @kbd{Alt+$} to go to end of line.

To reach a line, beginning of buffer, end of buffer, use Control+f then the appropriate key. Just read the prompt.

@section Selections and Deletions

Several alternatives offer to delete (cut) text.

@enumerate
@enumerate
@item
Use Control-x to cut the current line.
@item
Use Control + j,l to delete backward, forward char.
@item
Use Control + u to delete previous word.
@item
Use Control + $ to delete up to end of line.
@end enumerate
@item
Use Alt+d to trigger a prompt. This will offer you to delete what you want.
@item
Alternatively, first mark (select) text you want to select then use Control+x.
@end enumerate

Several alternatives offer to select text

@enumerate
@item
The paddle allow to directly select (``mark'') text : keep shift pressed, then move. While other ways are possible, using Alt-Shift-U, for example,
will select previous word (or extend current selection to previous word).

@item
An alternative in order to select text is to press Alt+a to set a mark, then move to extend selection.

@item
An alternative is to press Control+a to invoke ``a-'' prompt, allowing to select ``a-'' word, ``a-'' sentence, and so on, or to set the mark.

@item
To start a rectangular selection, use Control+Return.
@end enumerate


@section Cut Copy Paste

When no selection is active, use Control + x to cut current line, or a deletion command since deletions actually cut text.

Use Control + c to copy currrent line, or, while a selection is active, copy this selection.

Use Control + v to paste the current clipboard. Following Control + v will replace this paste with last clipboard item. However, if you need to paste several times, you can use Alt + v to invoke and advanced ``Paste'' prompt.



@section Undo or Redo

Use Alt+z to undo. Or, use Control+z to invoke undo-tree visualizer to play with discard changes in an advanced way.


@section Advanced Edition

Most avdanced editon features rely on Control-r, which will invoke replace prompt, allowing you to replace-regexp, merge-lines, delete spaces, or invoke other functions.

@enumerate
@item
Alt+y will copy to current line char under point (on the below line).
@item
Alt+e will copy to current line char above point (on the above line).
@end enumerate

Control+g global prompt will also propose goal-column feature.


@node Files Buffers Windows
@chapter Files Buffers Windows

Use Control + s to save current file, Alt + s to invoke a prompt to rename it.
Control+g ``global'' prompt will allow you to manipulate frames.
@verbatim
Â² will invoke buffers list.
@end verbatim


@enumerate
@item
Use Control+o to open a file, a window, a buffer, or use bookmarks,...
@item
Use Control+w to close this frame. Or Alt+w to make this frame the only visible one.
@item
Use Control+n to open a sracth buffer (blank untitled buffer).
@item
Use Control+t to open another tab.
@end enumerate 

@node NU & other libraries
@chapter NU & other libraries

How does NU integrate with other libraries?

@section evil-mode

While nu-mode is not a modal editor, and aims at being the most efficient keymap, sometimes using lot of modifiers might still be harassing. Using vim keymap is feasible : you can activate evil-mode, then switch from evil-state to emacs-state as you want.

Even while in evil-state, you will enjoy a few nu-mode keys, like Alt+v, Alt+f, and probably many others. However vim paddle (hjkl for left down up right) and nu-mode paddle (ijkl for up left down right) disagree on three of these four keys! If you want to have evil with nu-mode paddle, I recommend you to make vim paddle similar to nu-mode. Since @key{i} will not be available anymore to insert, use @key{h} for this purpose. Simply put below lines on your .emacs:

@lisp
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "h") 'evil-insert)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "j") 'evil-backward-char)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "i") 'evil-previous-line)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "k") 'evil-next-line)
@end lisp

Obviously this only fixes the basic paddle. Backward and Foward word are different, but fixing the paddle is fine.

@section magit

Use Alt+s, ie save-prompt, to gain access to magit-status.
