@node Overview
@chapter Overview

``Nu `` is a modern keybinding for Emacs.

nu-mode is a global minor mode, its keymap,
and the commands which are not provided in raw Emacs.

Modern, means respecting conventions like 
- ^f to find
- ^r to replace
- ^s to save
- ^x, ^c, ^v to cut, copy, paste

To preserve access to many functions, nu-mode relies on prompts. For example, Control+f raises a prompt precising which key to press to obtain which function => with Control+f then f start a regexp search, with Control+f then g go-to a line (to be precised), with Control+f then s go to previous selection.

nu-emacs does not only provides nu-mode. There are also two independant parts
- nu-alias is a simple mechanism to define aliases into org-mode file(s). This way its easier to maintain aliases to be invoked from Mx. See its REAME.
- dhammacakka is a light set of customization. See its README.

@chapter Help

Use Control-q to quit a sequence or a command in progress.
Use Alt+z to undo last command.

Prompts are usually triggered using a <Control> modifier and advertise an alternative Alt operating using the same key. Inverse is sometimes true : since <Control+s> invoking a prompt would be irritating, Control+s does not invoke a prompt. It directly saves buffer, while Alt+s is the ``save prompt''.

@node NU for the power user
@chapter NU for the power user

If you are not used to Emacs, reading this chapter is not necessary. But Emacs veteran should probably start here.

emacs-nu redefines many keys, however two points make learning curve shorter

- For any user, knowing CUA keybinds will make emacs-nu discoverable.
- For veteran Emacs user, two important sequences remain:


Mx is still there. This means, you can probably obtain what you want, just press Mx and you will not be lost.
Also, C-h for help-prefix is still there.

Now, three things should probably be kept in mind while trying nu-mode

- To repeat a command, use Alt <Space>.


- To trigger a major mode sequence, start with Control <Space>. This will invoke vanilla emacs C-c. For example, into org-mode, use C-<SPC> C-n to navigate to next node. If you already defined you own keys starting with C-c, do not amend this definition.
  define-global-key : C-c <some key>
  Then press Control+Space then <some key>


- You should not rely on C-x, or at least no regularly. However to trigger x prefix, use C-M-<SPC>


@node View and Edit
@chapter Navigate

While arrows still work, Nu uses alt key to navigate.
The thumb presses Alt key, while finger remains safe.
Navigate up left right down using Alt and :
 I
JKL

Additionally, use Alt u and alt o to move
to previous/next word.
U I O
 JKL

Use Alt$ to go to end of line.

To reach a line, beginning of buffer, end of buffer, use Control+f then the appropriate key. Just read the prompt.

@chapter Selections and Deletions

Use Control-x to cut the current line.
Use Control + paddle + j,l to delete backward, forward char
Use Control + u to delete previous word

Use Alt+d to trigger a prompt. This will offer you to delete what you want.


The paddle allow to directly select (``mark'') text.
While other ways are possible, using Alt-Shift-U, for example,
will select previous word (or extend current selection).

An alternative to select text is to Alt+a to set a mark, then move to extend selection. An alternative is to press Control+a to invoke ``a-'' prompt, allowing to select ``a-'' word, ``a-'' sentence, and so on, or to set the mark, including to start a rectangular selection.

@chapter Cut Copy Paste

When no selection is active, use Control + x to cut current line, or a deletion command since deletions actually cut text.

Use Control + c to copy currrent line, or, while a selection is active, copy this selection.

Use Control + v to paste the current clipboard. Following Control + v will replace this paste with last clipboard item. However, if you need to paste several times, you can use Alt + v to invoke and advanced ``Paste'' prompt.


@chapter Undo or Redo

Use Alt+z to undo. Or, use Control+z to invoke undo-tree visualizer to play with discard changes in an advanced way.

@chapter Advanced Edition

Most avdanced editon features rely on Control-r, which will invoke replace prompt, allowing you to replace-regexp, merge-lines, delete spaces, ...

Alt+y will copy to current line char under point (on the below line).
Alt+e will copy to current line char above point (on the above line).

Control+g global prompt will also propose goal-column feature.

@node Files Buffers Windows
@chapter Files Buffers Windows

Use Control + s to save current file, Alt + s to invoke a prompt to rename it.
Control+g ``global'' prompt will allow you to manipulate frames.
Â² will invoke buffers list.

Use Control+o to open a file, a window, a buffer, or use bookmarks,...
Use Control+w to close this frame. Or Alt+w to make this frame the only visible one.
Use Control+n to open a sracth buffer (blank untitled buffer).
