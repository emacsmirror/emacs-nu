1 Overview
**********

WARNING : this package has not yet reached 1.0.  It is subject to
change.

   "nu-mode " is a modern keybinding for Emacs.  It aims at respecting
modern conventions like 'Ctrl+c', 'Ctrl+v', while making editing as
comfortable as possible.  It also aims at making Emacs pretty easy &
discoverable.  It is, currently, primarily designed for azerty and
qwerty.  Dvoark or BÃ©po users might prefer ErgoEmacs at the moment.

   Technically, nu-mode is a global minor mode, its keymap
(nu-keymap), and few commands which are not provided in raw Emacs.
Using hooks, nu-mode does integrate with vanilla Emacs features like
isearch or org-mode, or external features like undo-tree or ivy
completion mechanism.

   Modern, means respecting conventions like
  1. 'Control-f' to find
  2. 'Control-r' to replace
  3. 'Control-s' to save
  4. 'Control-x', 'Control-c', 'Control-v' to cut, copy, paste.

   To allow user to leverage large panel of functions, nu-mode relies
on prompts.  For example, 'Control+f' will raise a "find-prompt"
offering several search related features.  A prompt is a pop-up
displaying a menu.  Each feature is accessible with a key.  This
prompt allows to discover features, and run many different commands
easily.

   There are, on the other hands, "immediate keys".  For example, to
isearch-forward-regexp (that is, "Find"), 'Alt+f' will directly run
the command.  So, it's still possible to trigger find using one direct
shortcut, but another one will allow to discover many features : grep,
occur, and so on.

   The prompt will display a list of keys - actually, sequences - and
associated functions : for example t to find-tag, w to
ace-jump-word-mode, m for imenu, b for regexp-builder, o for occur,
'Alt+f' to isearch-forward-regexp.

   Prompts are responsive according to mode or text being currently
selected : according to major mode or selection state, different
functions will be available or not.

1.1 Navigate
============

      I
    J K L

   nu-mode navigation is based on a paddle, an inversed T : while
arrows still work, nu-mode relies on <Alt> key to navigate.  <i> <j>
<k> <l> go up, left, down, right (previous line, backward char, next
line, forward char).  If 'Shift' is pressed while moving, this will
select or extend selection, as 'Shift' plus arrow does.

   If user prefers to use VI like keys to navigate, it is possible to
invoke '(vi-setup-vi-paddle)' This function will maintain <Alt> to
navigate, but <h> <j> <k> <l> will have the same meaning as in VI.

   The classic Nu paddle is the same as ErgoEmacs.  There are several
reasons leading to this choice ; the most important being <Alt> an
easy key to press with the thumb, thus sparing pinky finger.  Another
obvious reason is that many CUA keys are mainly on the bottom left
part of the keyboard, while 'Control' key associated with the paddle,
has a specific meaning.

   (Actually, any nu-mode function, is available from the <Alt> key
modifier, since prompts offer access to functions.)

   Additionally, use <Alt> <u> and <Alt> <o> to move to previous, next
word.

    U I O
    J K L

   Use 'Alt+$' to go to end of line, and 'Alt+h' (or, 'Alt+^' to go to
beginning of line.  'Shift' only works with <h> - but you can use mark
prompt for this.

   To reach a line, or the beginning of buffer, or the end of the
buffer, you could use goto prompt, available from 'Control+g'.  Just
read this goto-prompt, which offers to navigate per line, paragraph,
sentence and so on.  To find a char, a string, a line starting with a
specific letter, use avy-jump : also inside 'Alt+f' prompt.  To
directly trigger a regexp-search, use 'Control+f', which is another
way to navigate.

   Numeric arguments can apply to navigation.  Press 'Alt+1' then
'Alt+5' to input 15 as a numeric argument ; now input 'Alt+k' to go
down one line : this will go down 15 lines.

   'Repeat' also applies to navigation.  Enter 'Control+Return' to
repeat a navigation (or any command).

   However - let's finish with navigation.  Use 'Alt+Space' to scroll
(to the bottom), and 'Alt+Backspace' to go back to the top.

   Note that Emacs sometimes require you to scroll another window.
This is quite useful to go through *Help* buffer, for example.  If you
need this, use 'Control+Alt+Space'.  To scroll the other way around
the other window, use first a negative argument ('Alt+-').

   This navigation chapter is meant as a general introduction to
emacs-nu ; because navigation is a basis, but also because we saw many
emacs-nu principles :
  1. Direct keys for most common operations.
  2. Prompts for slighly less common to rare operations.
  3. Numeric arguments.
  4. Repeat.
  5. Few emacs convention respected, but some.

   These same principles apply to other prompts.

1.2 Selections and Deletion
===========================

Now that you can input text plus navigate, let's examine several
alternatives to delete (cut) text.  When there is some important text
to work with, it is possible to use 'Alt+a' to set mark, then move to
extend selection.  A little help will popup so you can use advanced
features.

   Rectangle selection need to invoke the selection prompt :
'Control+a'.  Similarly to classic selection, rectangle selection
offer a little popup to help the user discovering how to work.

   Sometimes it is more convenient not to select text, but rather to
directly delete some text.

  1. Use 'Alt + x' to cut the current line.
  2. Use 'Control + j','Control + l' to delete backward, forward char.
     Backspace / Delete are still available.
  3. Use 'Control + u' to delete previous word.
  4. Use 'Control + $' to delete up to end of line.
  5. Use 'Control +x' to trigger a delete prompt.  This will offer you
     to delete what you want (function, org-node, sentence, ...).
  6. As seen above, alternatively, first mark (select) text you want.

1.3 Cut Copy Paste
==================

When no selection is active, use 'Alt + x' to cut current line, or a
deletion command since deletions actually cut text (as a reminder :
emacs 'kill-' commands will copy to kill-ring, while emacs 'delete-'
commands will not).

   Use 'Alt + c' to copy currrent line, or, while a selection is
active, copy this selection.

   Use 'Alt + v' to paste the current clipboard.  Or, you can use
'Control + v' to invoke an advanced "Paste" prompt.

1.4 Undo or Redo
================

As expected, use 'Alt+z' to undo or 'Control+z' to access the full
features or undo visualize.

   This screen displays last changes, and you can navigate these using
the paddle : 'i' (redo), 'j' (switch to left branch), 'Alt+k' (redo),
'l' (switch to right branch).  Press <q> to quit this screen or
'Alt+q' to abort.  You can also toggle selection mode with <s> or
toggle timestamps using <t>.

1.5 Dependencies
================

nu-mode depends on several libraries, both native or external ones.
  1. recentf
  2. undo-tree

   These are all optional dependencies.  First user might one of
following completion framework.
  1. helm
  2. ivy

   Then user might want to be able to access some features.
  1. help-fns+, to describe-keymap
  2. ace-jump
  3. magit

1.6 Help
========

Use 'Control+q' to quit a sequence or a command in progress.  Use
'Control+z' to undo last command.  Use 'Control+h' to gain access to
help functions.  This includes the usual shortcuts to describe what a
key does, or what a function does.  Use 'Alt+q' prompt to quit Emacs
(or run some other function).

   Prompts are usually triggered using a 'Alt' modifier and advertise
a function using the same key, but with 'Control' modifier.  For
example, 'Alt+s' will pop-up a save prompt offering several features,
while 'Control+s' directly saves the current buffer.

   These prompts offer you to quickly learn where functions are.

1.7 Menus and Prompters
=======================

This section should explain
  1. the menu that is, the content : the menus are the group of
     functions that can be accessed.  menus are not organized as menus
     (toolbar) in vanilla Emacs.  These are more close to Spacemacs :
     menus are grouped by themes.  Major mode should include its func
     in various menus, not in one single menus.
  2. the prompters are the method to trigger a func inside the menu,
     prompters are the interface.

   If you want to see all available menus, press <Control+h <space>>
to invoke cheat sheet, then look for prompts functions.

   The menus are organized by actions, like : finding, opening,
deleting, replacing.  The menus are *not* organized by objects, like :
buffers, frames, registers.  Regarding this organization, the
disadvantage is to split a set of functions accross various menus.
Advantages - It feels intuitive to use a logic like <new> <window>,
<delete> <window> rather than <window> <new>, <window> <delete> though
it might depend on native language of user - It helps having a
balanced number of menus, with balanced items.  - It is more
consistent with CUA shortcuts.  CUA shortcuts like control+f find,
control+n new, are not representing objects, but functions.

  1. help menu is not a prompt but is a map.  Press 'Control+h' to
     view many help function.  Install help-fns+ to obtain even more
     functions.

  2. nu-a-prompt (selection) this menu is an alternative to set mark.
     it provides few functions regarding selection.

     it also offers to select a directory.

  3. replace This group includes replace, transpose, sort functions.
     it does not include markdown, indentation => see bold prompt

  4. print component allows printing, but also evaluating, compiling,
     converting.  it is also macro evaluation.

  5. quit menu allows few quit related func.

  6. save menu offers to save file, register, bookmarks, session,
     link...  anything you want to keep for later!

  7. find menu allows to search, occur, find tag, grep, build
     regexp...

  8. goto menu is for other navigation (not found in other prompts).
     This includes going to other window (ace-window).

     you might also look at window, and obviously find prompts.

  9. window menu is for window management.

     This inludes scrolling, sizing, transpose.  This does not include
     window creation (Alt+t or new menu)

  10. delete menu prompt allows to delete text, file, buffer, window.

  11. copy menu menu is currently limited.

  12. insert menu allows to insert text, snippets, command, abbrev...
     If you want to evaluate, see Print.

  13. bold menu is for capitalize, indent, markdown it does not offer
     to transpose, sort.  See Replace.

  14. new menu is either for creation (file, dir, mail) or invoke a
     process (term, calc, command)

  15. open should open something already existing : file, register,
     buffer, bookmarks, mails

   The standard prompt is the "light" prompt.  It does only popup a
little message.  A key can directly be pressed to trigger the
associated function.  If the user does not know yet the function, or
the key, he might use

  1. <q> does always quit prompt.
  2. Pressing <<tab>> will raise a "full-prompt".  First, a full
     prompt will display available keys (what key sequences do not
     have).  Second, a prompt will also advertise direct shortcuts to
     commands : ie, shortcuts that would have directly run some
     function without going through the prompts.  For example, using
     'Control+g' prompt, it is possible to press g to 'ace-window, but
     prompt will also advertise that 'Alt+g' would have directly
     called this same function without requiring to go through a
     prompt.  This does not mean using the prompt was wrong.  It is
     rather meant as a way to discover and as a reminder, since
     nu-mode has many alternatives.
  3. Pressing <<space>> will raise a "completion-prompt".  This will
     use a completion mechanism to select the desired function.
  4. Pressing <?> will allow to call describe-function on a function,
     rather than running it
  5. Prompts allow you to use arguments in two ways.  The first way,
     is to use standard Emacs keys to trigger an argument (eg,
     'Control+1', or 'Alt+1', or 'Alt+-', or use the universal
     argument which is bound in nu-mode to 'Alt+p'), then run the
     prompt, then choose the command that will be affected by the
     argument.  The second way to use arguments is to first run the
     prompt, then directly press a digit or - to increment the
     argument.  Then, press the relevant key to run the desired
     function.
  6. A prompt can be toggled to some 'repeat' state.  Run a prompt,
     then press <+>.  You can then use the prompt as usual, except
     that after running the function, prompt will ask you again for a
     key, with the same keymap.  Escape the prompt pressing any
     unbound key.

   The "do-prompt" from <Alt+d> is different.  "do-prompt" directly
displays all possible keys.  It offers several frequent features, and
also offers to open a prompt.  This makes possible to completely skip
the <Control> key.

   While it would be possible to handle buffers or open files using
prompts, "do-prompt" offers direct keys for this, making it possible
to avoid other prompts most of the time.  On the other hand the
"do-prompt" does not add anything to Nu.  It is only a matter of
convenience, but usage has shown this to be very useful.

1.8 Advanced Edition
====================

Some advanced editon features rely on 'Alt+r', which will invoke
replace prompt, allowing you to replace-regexp, merge-lines, delete
spaces, or invoke other functions ('Control+r' directly triggers
replace-regexp).

  1. 'Alt+y' will copy to current line char under point (on the below
     line).
  2. 'Alt+e' will copy to current line char above point (on the above
     line).

   'Control+s' prompt allows you to save current column as a
goal-column.  While you move next and previous lines, cursor will try
to reach this column as far as possibe.

   'Alt+b' will run nu-bold, which will act differently according to
major-mode.  This try to emphasis, which might have a different
meaning given the mode.  'Control+b' will run an emphasis (bold)
prompt, allowing to indent, fill-paragraph, and so on.

2 Files Buffers Windows
***********************

2.1 Internal Windows and Tabs
=============================

Use 'Control+o' prompt to open a buffer.  'Alt+n' allows you to create
another internal window ; 'Control+n' would prompt, allowing for
example to vertical split or open another external frame or so.
'Alt+w' allows you to kill buffer.

   Use 'Alt+t' to open another tab (horizontal-split).  'Control+t'
will prompt for which buffer to open in another window.

   The delete prompt ('Alt+d d') allows to delete either this window
or all other windows.  The save prompt ('Control+s') allows to save
current configuration, which you can open from open prompt
('Control+o').

   To navigate current internal windows, use the tab prompt
('Control+t').  Note that, in order to switch to another tab, you
could also call ace-jump-char-mode ('Control+f l'.  If you actually
just need to scroll another tab, stay in current one and use
'Control+Alt+Space' to 'scroll-other-window'.

2.2 Files, Bookmarks
====================

Use 'Alt+s' to save current file, 'Control+s' to invoke a prompt to
rename it.  'Control+o' to open a file, or 'Alt+d i'.  You can also
have bookmarks : use the same open-prompt and save-prompt for this.

   You can open a directory, too.

   dired is the emacs file manager.  You can easily use regexp to
open, delete, copy, rename files.  And since you are using nu-mode,
this is regexp-file-management-for-human-beings ,).  See the relevant
section on Integration.

2.3 External Windows
====================

It is possible, from Emacs to handle a bit of window management.  But
you should rather use a decent window manager.  Look however at the
save proompt...

3 Completion
************

It is possible not to use any completion system using emacs-nu.
However i recommend to use *ivy*.

     (nu-setup-ivy)

   An alternative is *helm-mode*

     (nu-setup-helm)

   These convenience functions will bind some features, like
find-files, M-x, search, to corresponding function in Ivy or Helm.
Ivy completion system displays some help.  Helm does not popup help
yet.


File: nu-mode.info,  Node: Hacking,  Next: Advanced Usage,  Prev: Completion,  Up: Top

4 Hacking
*********

The print buffer, invoked from 'Control+p', will offer you to eval
things or make (compile).  The insert prompt, invoked from
'Control+v', will allow you to insert a file, or the result of an
async shell command into a new buffer.  The save prompt, from
'Control+s', offers to use git power thanks to magit.

   'Control+p' also offers to grep, find-grep or ediff.

   As seen above, 'Control+b' will run an emphasis-prompt, which
allows to comment.  Onto c-mode or various lisp-mode, 'Alt+b' will
toggle comments.

   'Control+s' prompt also allows you to create tags to find
definitions.


File: nu-mode.info,  Node: Advanced Usage,  Next: Customization,  Prev: Hacking,  Up: Top

5 Advanced Usage
****************

  1. To trigger a major mode sequence, start with 'Control+Space'.
     This will invoke vanilla emacs 'Control+c'.  After this shortcut
     is pressed, a list of available functions will appear on the
     bottom of the screen.

     If you already defined you own keys starting with 'Control+c', do
     not amend this definition.

          (define-key mykeymap kbd("\C-c h") 'myfunction)

     To invoke above myfunction example, press 'Control-SPC h'.

  2. You should not rely on 'Control+x' in its vanilla Emacs meaning,
     however to trigger x prefix, use 'Alt+d e'.  This will raise a
     prompt to trigger Control-X-Prefix.

   'Repeat' is invoked from 'Control+Return'.  It was hacked to work
with prompts : thus, you can repeat a command ran from a prompt.
Prefix arguments (numeric-argument, negative-argument) can work :
either use standard 'Alt+1', 'Alt+2' ...  shortcuts plus one command.
Or, from a prompts, directly type a figure (or, a number) then choose
the command (eg, from delete prompt, type <3> then invoke kill-word to
kill 3 words ; or type <2> then <3> to input 23).  Alternatively,
first trigger the argument from standard shortcuts, then call the
prompt.  What is invoked from the prompt will make use of that
argument.

   Note that 'where-is' function, which sometimes advertises
shortcuts, will not work as usual, since a prompt is not a keymap :
'where-is' do not know how to invoke 'Control-r' then 'r' to invoke
replace-regexp.

   Thus for each function accessible from a prompt, an additional
shortcut is created, accessible from 'menu' plus the same 'key' than
the prompt, in order to make where-is advertise.  Hence, if you read
'You can run this command with <menu> r k', please understand, despite
it is also true, that you can also run the command with 'Control-r-k'.

6 Customization
***************

As ususal with Emacs, customization comes down at the very first
usage.  So even before to describe edition, customization has to be
mentioned.  There is not a single defcustom inside nu-mode.  All
customization is to be done in other ways.

6.1 I prefer VI keys for basic movement
=======================================

Below code will make h j k l behave like like VI. Beggining of line
become i.

     (nu-setup-vi-paddle)

6.2 I don't like the Alt modifier for the paddle
================================================

While it is easy (simply bind Control+ [ijkluo] to the movement, this
is not recommended, since alt key is suppose to offer *any function*.

6.3 Prompts
===========

If you want prompts to automatically prompt a buffer rather than just
a 'nu-light-prompt-for-keymap, which is the default, use :

       (defalias 'nu-prompt-for-keymap 'nu-buffer-prompt-for-keymap)

   If you dislike both nu-buffer-prompt-for-keymap and default
nu-light-prompt-for-keymap, you might also remove prompt mechanism

   This way you maintain the benefit of responsive menus, but meet no
more prompts.

   Finally you might also write your own prompt.  See for example
which-key prompt for a simple example.

6.4 Menus
=========

if you want to amend a menu, either to customize your own setup or to
develop a package to integrate a mode with nu-mode, you should define
a function which add keybindings to one or more nu-mode menus.

     (defun my-nu-mode-menu-customization ()
       (if (eq nu-major-mode 'org-mode)
           (define-key nu-window-map "a" 'delete-window)))

   Then add the function to nu-populate-hook

     (add-hook 'nu-populate-hook 'my-nu-mode-menu-customization)

   The hook documentations does provide some conventions.

6.5 Main keymap & free keys
===========================

If you want to amend nu-mode keymap, amend nu-keymap.  It is part of
minor-mode-overrind-map-alist.

   Free keys are
  1. <Control+c> + somme letter.  This is the standard Emacs
     convention.
  2. <Control> or <Alt> + punctuation, except $ or ^, as in VI.
  3. <Control>+<Alt> + anything
  4. <Control>+<Shift> + anything
  5. <Alt>+<Shift> + anything

6.6 Completion
==============

Please refer to chapter Completion for ivy & helm.  Nu-mode might
later integrate more completion systems.

7 Integration
*************

nu-mode is to be responsive - in order for major modes to preserve
nu-mode philosophy, prompts plus some direct keys will change
according to the context : mainly major-mode.  More globally, nu-mode
does integrate with other libraries.

7.1 Major-mode : dired
======================

As expected, most of vanilla *Dired* keys are respected : these are
keys which should, in Fundamental mode for example, run
self-insert-key - for example, <d> will mark a file for deletion.  You
might also use <h> so available keys will be displayed at the bottom
of the window.

   Dired allows to use nu-mode shortcuts to navigate : the 'Alt+i' &
'k' paddle allow to navigate the list, while 'j' will go up to parent
directory and 'l' will find-file at point (for example, visit
directory at point).

   Some prompts are adapted to dired : selections (with 'Alt+a') for
example, will provide the different dired options to mark files.  Look
at "replace", "insert", "find" prompts and so on.  Where it make sense
the usual prompts will be useful inside dired.  Keys that *remain*
useful inside dired are kept.

   Use 'Control+p' (uniserval-argument) then <s> key to edit the ls
command.

7.2 Major-mode / Minor-mode : org
=================================

nu-mode has many features related to org.  Rather than storing all
org-related features in one place, nu-mode does enrich its usual
prompts or even commands given the org-mode context.  You can also use
the <Control+Space> to discover all org mode features.

   'Alt+n' new prompt allows to capture a note.  Using open-prompt, it
is possible to open agenda.  'Alt+s' prompt will allow you to
org-store-link.  'Alt+v' prompt will allow to paste an org link.  This
same prompt offers to org-table-insert-column or row.  It is possible
to insert a timestamp or directly a deadline.  'Control+b' will run
org-emphasis.  'Alt+b' print prompt allows to expand ("print"), which
does correspond to what org-modes binds to Alt+Tab, which is an
*awful* choice.  It is also possible to delete a node from the delete
prompt.  One can org-mark-ring-goto using goto prompt.

   Note that shift selectections do not work with org-mode.

7.3 Major-mode : magit
======================

Use <Control+s>, ie save-prompt, to gain access to magit-status.

   Magit already is very easy to use, since you might press <h> to
discover its features.

7.4 Major-mode : term
=====================

term is a major mode which has two components (sub-modes)
  1. char mode
  2. line mode

   Default (startup) is char mode.

   Char mode is like a real terminal.  This allows you to do real
stuff, including terminal embedded interfaces.  On the other hand,
shortcuts are not available since keys are directly sent to term.
There is an exception however : press <Control+c l> (or,
<Control+space l>) and you will access a unique prompt.  This prompt
allows you to navigate to other buffers, trigger line-mode, cancel
current command, or call another prompt.

   Basically in term mode you only run commands, plus navigate.

   When you want to select output or navigate more seriously, just use
the line sub-mode.  In line-mode, nu-keymap is not amended.  The
advantage is to gain nu-keymap + some emulation, obviously on the
other hand this is not anymore a full term emulation since keys are
not directly sent.

   From line mode, press control+space to gain a dedicated prompt,
allowing several terminal related features like returning to char
moode.

7.5 Major-mode : texinfo
========================

Texinfo has little add-ons to prompts : "print" prompt will offer to
makeinfo or convert to pdf, and "insert" prompt to texinfo-insert...

7.6 Minor-mode : auto-complete
==============================

There isn't much to say.  Auto-complete does integrate well, that's
all!

7.7 Minor-mode : god-mode
=========================

God mode works but, is not binded.  You would have to assign a key
yourself to trigger god-mode.

7.8 Minor-mode : evil-mode
==========================

While nu-mode is not a modal editor, and aims at being the most
efficient keymap, sometimes using lot of modifiers might still be
harassing.  Technically using vim keymap is feasible : you can
activate evil-mode, then switch from evil-state to emacs-state as you
want.

   Either make VI normal-state use the nu-mode paddle.

     (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "h") 'evil-insert)
     (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "j") 'evil-backward-char)
     (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "i") 'evil-previous-line)
     (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "k") 'evil-next-line)

   Or, make nu-mode use the VI paddle.

   However i would not recommend working like this.  nu-mode is
thought to work in non-modal, modern editing.  It does not need modes.

   Using vanilla evil or spacemacs might be an alternative.

8 Drawbacks & Limits
********************

  1. There might be bugs on emacs-nu
  2. Emacs-nu is meant for azerty, qwzerty.  It would not be very good
     with other layouts However the plan for other layouts might be
     simple.  Control + key should stick to the mnemonic, like Ctrl+s
     to display save prompt.  While immediate keys like Alt+s or,
     obviously, the paddle Alt+i / Alt+j / Alt+k / Alt+l, should be
     transposed according to layout.  Control+h key to display Cheat
     Sheet, plus prompts, will help memorizing.

Emacs nu is moving to a "one file per feature" style.  There are files
for common, core nu-mode, then files for integrating it.  For example
there is a nu-isearch.el file, a nu-ibuffer.el file.  I do expect to
isolate a file per mode.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                    Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
     other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of
     freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
     redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
     commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License
     preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
     their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
     copyleft license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a
     notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
     duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
     The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any
     member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".
     You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work
     in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing
     the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
     Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
     relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the
     subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the
     Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
     none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text
     may be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
     copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to
     the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
     to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats
     include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
     formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
     processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools
     are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
     PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
     purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
     itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
     the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
     For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
     "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
     the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
     text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes
     copies of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
     parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
     language.  (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
     below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements",
     or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
     you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled
     XYZ" according to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
     in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any
     other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is
     void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
     you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.
     You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
     reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
     However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If
     you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
     follow the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
     and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also
     clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
     copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
     words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
     other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
     limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
     Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
     copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location
     from which the general network-using public has access to
     download using public-standard network protocols a complete
     Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you
     use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
     when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
     ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at
     the stated location until at least one year after the last time
     you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
     of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version
     to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do
     these things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be
          listed in the History section of the Document).  You may use
          the same title as a previous version if the original
          publisher of that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown
          in the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History"
          in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
          authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title
          Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as
          stated in the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for
          a work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or
          "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and
          preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each
          of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
          therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section
          numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the
          section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do
     this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
     Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct
     from any other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
     contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
     various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
     the text has been approved by an organization as the
     authoritative definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If
     the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or
     to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
     single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the
     same name but different contents, make the title of each such
     section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
     name of the original author or publisher of that section if
     known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
     section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
     notice of the combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single
     copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow
     the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you
     insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
     follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
     copying of that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
     individual works permit.  When the Document is included in an
     aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
     aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the
     Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,
     or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in
     electronic form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers
     that bracket the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
     section 4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations
     requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you
     may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
     addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
     You may include a translation of this License, and all the
     license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
     provided that you also include the original English version of
     this License and the original versions of those notices and
     disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the translation
     and the original version of this License or a notice or
     disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing
     the actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of
     the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time
     you have received notice of violation of this License (for any
     work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation
     prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used,
     that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
     permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
     Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means
     any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and
     also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
     works.  A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such
     a server.  A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC")
     contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus
     published on the MMC site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a
     not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in
     San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of
     that license published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole
     or in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
