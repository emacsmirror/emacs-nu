1 Overview
**********

"Nu " is a modern keybinding for Emacs.

   nu-mode is a global minor mode, its keymap, and the commands which
are not provided in raw Emacs.

   Modern, means respecting conventions like
  1. 'Control-f' to find
  2. 'Control-r' to replace
  3. 'Control-s' to save
  4. 'Control-x', 'Control-c', 'Control-v' to cut, copy, paste.

   To allow user to leverage large panel of functions, nu-mode relies on
prompts.  For example, 'Control-r' raises a prompt precising which key -
actually, which sequence - to press in order to execute desired function
: once 'Control-r' has been pressed and the "Replace-prompt" appears,
pressing <r> will offer to replace-regexp, <a> will revert buffer, while
'k' will trigger overwrite-mode, or 'j' will join current line with
following line.

   Most common shortcuts - ie, common to most applications - respect
this guideline.  Thus, there is a prompt for 's', 'v', 'a'...  Almost
all prompts rely on Control modifier to be run.  There are exceptions.
Since 'Control+s' invoking a prompt would be irritating, this sequence
directly saves buffer, while 'Alt+s' runs the "save prompt".

   nu-emacs does not only provides nu-mode.  There are also two
independant parts
  1. nu-alias is a simple mechanism to define aliases into org-mode
     file(s).  This way its easier to maintain aliases to be invoked
     from Mx.  See its REAME.
  2. dhammacakka is a light set of customization.  See its README.

1.1 Dependencies
================

Nu depends on several libraries, both native or external ones :
  1. help-fns+
  2. undo-tree
  3. ace-jump
  4. recentf
  5. cua-selection-mode
  6. magit is optional

1.2 Help
========

Use 'Control-q' to quit a sequence or a command in progress.  Use
'Alt+z' to undo last command.  Use 'Control+h' to gain access to help
functions.  This includes the usual shortcuts to describe what a key
does, or what a function does.  If you messed up, use 'Control+w' then
'Control+q' to quit.

   Prompts are usually triggered using a 'Control' modifier and
advertise a function using the same key, but with 'Alt' modifier.  For
example, 'Control-n' will pop-up a new-prompt, while 'Alt-n' will
directly create some new untitled buffer.

   These prompts offer you to quickly learn where functions are.

1.3 Prompts
===========

Prompts are basically a window showing several possible keys, and which
functions are to be run given this input.  However some features deserve
some deeper explanation.

   First, as explained below a prompt will explain how to use it,
however prompt will also advertise direct shortcuts to commands : ie,
shortcuts that would have directly run some function without going
through the prompts.  This does not mean using the prompt was wrong.  It
is rather meant as a way to discover and as a reminder, since nu-mode
has many alternatives.

   Second, a prompt allows you to use arguments in two ways.  The first
way, is to use standard Emacs keys to trigger an argument (eg,
'Control+1', or 'Alt+1', or 'Alt+-', or use the universal argument which
is bound in nu-mode to 'Alt+p'), then run the prompt, then choose the
command that will be affected by the argument.  The second way to use
arguments is to first run the prompt, then directly press a digit or -
to increment the argument.  Then, press the relevant key to run the
desired function.

   Third, a prompt also allows to get some help about functions.  Run
the prompt, press ?, then the same keymap as usual will not run
functions but describe functions.  For example, while 'replace-prompt'
ususally run 'revert-buffer' on <a> press, once ?  has been pressed, <a>
will instead describe function 'revert-buffer'.

   Fourth, a prompt can be toggled to some 'repeat' state.  Run a
prompt, then press <+>.  You can then use the prompt as usual, except
that after running the function, prompt will ask you again for a key,
with the same keymap.  Escape the prompt pressing any unbound key.  You
might notice is does allow some sort of modal editing, but this is not
really the intented behaviour.  This feature is rather made to make some
commands easier, for example deleting a paragraph then two word then a
character.  Modal editing is possible using nu-mode, see below.

   Fifth, a prompt can be scrolled using <space> and <backspace>.

   Sixth, a prompt can always be escaped using 'q'.  This letter is
never bound.  You can always use it.  Note that 'Control+q' and 'Alt+q'
are neither bound.  However, <Q> -ie, shift plus q - might be bound,
because 'Shift+q' cannot be a mistake.

***************

Obviously just type keys to input text.  With slight notes : 'Alt+m'to
carriage return + indent.  Use 'Alt+v' + c to insert literally a
character.

2.1 Navigate
============

While arrows still work, Nu uses <Alt> key to navigate.  Hence, the
thumb often presses <Alt> key, while pinky finger remains safe.  This is
exactly the same principle than ErgoEmacs applies.  Navigate up left
right down using <Alt> and :

       I
     J K L

   Additionally, use <Alt> <u> and <Alt> <o> to move to previous, next
word.

     U I O
     J K L

   Use 'Alt+$' to go to end of line, or 'Alt+h' to go beginning of line.
To reach a line, or the beginning of buffer, or the end of the buffer,
use 'Alt+g' then the appropriate key.  Just read this goto-prompt.  To
find a char, a string, a line starting with a specific letter, use
'Alt+f'.  To directly trigger a regexp-search, use 'Control+f'.

   Notice that f key, used both with 'control' and 'alt' modifiers,
offers find-related features.  One of these keys is direct : it directly
executes a command, & maybe a very common one.  The other key does raise
a prompt to offer more features.  This principle to have one 'alt'
modifier plus one 'control' modifier applies to other keys, as well.

   Numeric arguments can apply to navigation.  Press 'Alt+1' then
'Alt+5' to input 15 as a numeric argument ; now input 'Alt+k' to go down
one line : this will go down 15 lines.

   'Repeat' also applies to navigation.  Enter 'Control+Return' to
repeat a navigation.

   However - let's finish with navigation.  Use 'Alt+Space' to scroll
(to the bottom), and 'Alt+Backspace' to go back to the top.  Emacs
vanilla keybindings for 'help-mode' and some other offer Space and
Backspace to do this - this is one of the few conventions respected into
Emacs-nu.  Yup.

   Note that emacs sometimes require you to scroll another window.  This
is quite useful to go through *Help* buffer, for example.  If you need
this, use 'Control+Alt+Space'.  To scroll the other way around the other
window, use first a negative argument ('Alt+-').

   This navigation chapter is meant as a general introduction to
emacs-nu ; because navigation is a basis, but also because we saw many
emacs-nu principles :
  1. Direct keys for most common operations.
  2. Prompts for slighly less common to rare operations.
  3. Numeric arguments.
  4. Repeat.
  5. Few emacs convention respected, but some.

   These same principles apply to other prompts.

2.2 Selections and Deletion
===========================

Now that you can input text plus navigate, let's examine several
alternatives to delete (cut) text.

       1. Use 'Control-x' to cut the current line.
       2. Use 'Control+j','Control+l' to delete backward, forward char.
          Backspace / Delete are still available.
       3. Use 'Control + u' to delete previous word.
       4. Use 'Control + $' to delete up to end of line.
  1. Use 'Alt+d' to trigger a prompt.  This will offer you to delete
     what you want (function, org-node, sentence, ...).
  2. Alternatively, first mark (select) text you want to select then use
     'Control+x'.

   Right, but how to select?  Once again, several alternatives...here we
go

  1. The paddle allow to directly select ("mark") text : keep 'shift'
     pressed, then move either with arrows or 'Alt+<some key of the
     paddle>'.  Using 'Alt-Shift-u', for example, will select previous
     word (or extend current selection to previous word).

  2. An alternative in order to select text is to press 'Alt+a' to set a
     mark, then move to extend selection.  You can also use a direct key
     to set a rectangular mark : 'Control+S', ie 'Control+Shift+s'.

  3. An alternative is to press 'Control+a' to invoke "a-" prompt,
     allowing to select "a-" word, "a-" sentence, and so on, or to set
     the mark.  Or, to set a rectangular mark.  Read the prompt!

   Once some text is selected you can "toggle the point and mark" using
'Control+a', or deactivate the selection using 'Alt+a', or cut the text
using 'Control+x' (or 'Alt+d' might be nice depending on your fingers
position).

2.3 Cut Copy Paste
==================

When no selection is active, use 'Control + x' to cut current line, or a
deletion command since deletions actually cut text (as a reminder :
emacs 'kill-' commands will copy to kill-ring, while emacs 'delete-'
commands will not).

   Use 'Control + c' to copy currrent line, or, while a selection is
active, copy this selection.

   Use 'Control + v' to paste the current clipboard.  Following 'Control
+ v' will replace this paste with precedent clipboard item.  However, if
you need to paste several times, first invoke a numeric prefix argument
to specify how many times to paste, then type 'Control+v'.  Or, you can
use 'Alt + v' to invoke an advanced "Paste" prompt.

2.4 Undo or Redo
================

Use 'Alt+z' to undo.  Or, use 'Control+z' to invoke undo-tree visualizer
to play with discard changes in an advanced way.  This screen displays
last changes, and you can navigate these using the paddle ('Alt+i',
'Alt+j', 'Alt+k', 'Alt+l').  Press <q> to quit this screen.

   It is also possible to directly redo using 'Control+Shift+z'.

2.5 Advanced Edition
====================

Some advanced editon features rely on 'Control-r', which will invoke
replace prompt, allowing you to replace-regexp, merge-lines, delete
spaces, or invoke other functions.

  1. 'Alt+y' will copy to current line char under point (on the below
     line).
  2. 'Alt+e' will copy to current line char above point (on the above
     line).

   'Alt+v' prompt to open a line.  'Alt+s' prompt allows you to save
current column as a goal-column.  While you move next and previous
lines, cursor will try to reach this column as far as possibe.

   'Control+b' will run nu-bold, which will act differently according to
major-mode.  This try to emphasis, which might have a different meaning
given the mode.  'Alt+b' will run an emphasis (bold) prompt, allowing to
indent, fill-paragraph, and so on.

3 Files Buffers Windows
***********************

Use 'Control+s' to save current file, 'Alt+s' to invoke a prompt to
rename it.
  1. Use 'Control+o' to open a file, a window, a buffer, or use
     bookmarks,...  Or move to another frame...or buffers list...  You
     can use 'Control+Shift+o' to directly be prompted for a buffer to
     open.  Or, 'Control+Shift+i' to direclty open next buffer, skipping
     *Messages* or *Backtrace* and the like.
  2. Use 'Control+w' to close current window.  Note that 'Alt+w' raises
     a prompt with far more options.
  3. Use 'Control+n' to raise a prompt in order to create a new untitled
     document or split window.  As the opposite of new, 'Alt+n' will
     delete current window.
  4. Use 'Control+t' to open another tab.  It directly shows up an
     ibuffer list.  Key 'Alt+t' would swith from a 'tab' to another one
     (other-window).

Â² will invoke buffers list on the current frame. The tab invokes on another one.

4 Hacking
*********

The print buffer, invoked from 'Control+p', will offer you to eval
things or make (compile).  The insert prompt, invoked from 'Alt+v', will
allow you to insert a file, or the result of an async shell command into
a new buffer.  The save buffer, from 'Alt+s', offers to use git power to
save cats or so.

   'Control+p' also offers to grep, find-grep or ediff.

   As seen above, 'Alt+b' will run an emphasis-prompt, which allows to
comment.  Onto c-mode or various lisp-mode, 'Control+b' will toggle
comments.

5 NU for the power user
***********************

If you are not used to Emacs, reading this chapter is not necessary.
But Emacs veteran should probably start here.  emacs-nu redefines many
keys, however two points make learning curve shorter

  1. For any user, knowing CUA keybinds will make emacs-nu discoverable.
  2. For veteran Emacs user, two important sequences remain:

   'M-x' is still there.  This means, you can probably obtain what you
want.  Also, 'Control+h' for help-prefix is still there.

   Now, two things should probably be kept in mind while trying nu-mode

  1. To trigger a major mode sequence, start with 'Control+Space'.  This
     will invoke vanilla emacs 'Control+c'.  For example, into org-mode,
     use 'Control+Space Control+n' to navigate to next node.  If you
     already defined you own keys starting with 'Control+c', do not
     amend this definition.

          (define-key mykeymap kbd("\C-c h") myfunction)

     To invoke above myfunction example, press 'Control-SPC h'.

  2. You should not rely on 'Control+x', or at least no regularly.
     However to trigger x prefix, use 'Control+g'.  This will raise a
     prompt to trigger Control-X-Prefix.

   'Repeat' is invoked from 'Control+Return'.  It was hacked to work
with prompts : thus, you can repeat a command ran from a prompt.  Prefix
arguments (numeric-argument, negative-argument) can work : either use
standard 'Alt+1', 'Alt+2' ...  shortcuts plus one command.  Or, from a
prompts, directly type a figure (or, a number) then choose the command
(eg, from delete prompt, type <3> then invoke kill-word to kill 3 words
; or type <2> then <3> to input 23).  Alternatively, first trigger the
argument from standard shortcuts, then call the prompt.  What is invoked
from the prompt will make use of that argument.

   Note that 'where-is' function, which sometimes advertises shortcuts,
will not work as usual, since a prompt is not a keymap : 'where-is' do
not know how to invoke 'Control-r' then 'r' to invoke replace-regexp.
(Did you try 'where-is git push' in magit?  this does not work.  What is
acceptable for maggit is not for a full keymap.)

   Thus :
  1. For each function accessible from a prompt, an additional shortcut
     is created, accessible from 'menu' plus the same 'key' than the
     prompt, in order to make where-is advertise.  Hence, if you read
     'You can run this command with <menu> r k', please understand,
     despite it is also true, that you can also run the command with
     'Control-r-k'.
  2. From the help prompt ('Control-h'), run <h> to invoke nu-help.
     This function will present you all prompts, and will offer you to
     describe their keymaps - that is, all the functions you can access
     from these prompts.

6 NU and some specific modes
****************************

term is perfectly usable with nu-mode.  Just press Control+Space then
Control+c to run a sigstop.  Or, Control+Space then Control+b to open
another buffer.  The vanilla x keymap is used.  As of today there is no
prompt however.


File: nu.info,  Node: NU & other libraries,  Next: Contributing,  Prev: NU and some specific modes,  Up: Top

7 NU & other libraries
**********************

How does NU integrate with other libraries?

7.1 org
=======

As of today, NU has some features related to org.  'Alt+s' prompt will
allow you to org-store-link.  'Alt+v' prompt will allow you to
org-table-insert-column or row.  It is possible to insert a timestamp.
The Control+Space Control+Space shortcut will trigger what would have
been Control+c Control+c.  'Control+b' will run org-emphasis.  Using
open-prompt, it is possible to open agenda.

   It is also possible to delete a node from the delete prompt.  As you
see, rather than storing all org-related features in one place, nu-mode
does enrich its usual prompts or even commands given the org-mode
context.

7.2 magit
=========

Use Alt+s, ie save-prompt, to gain access to magit-status.

7.3 god-mode
============

god-mode is one possible modal editing.  See below about evil-mode.
god-mode can be toggled using 'Control+g'.  Using vanilla god-mode, it
is then possible to quit god-mode pressing 'Control+g' again (the
modifier is necessary).

   I'm currently waiting for a patch to be integrated, in order to allow
god-mode to allow configuring which modifier is added to keys.  This
patch will allow to use god-mode with alt automatically triggered.
Forward / Backward char / line / word will be one key distant, while
delete prompts becomes nicer.  Commands relying on 'Control' modifier
will be triggered with <g> key.  Using this, quitting god-mode is 'gg',
since first g will toggle Control modifier.

7.4 evil-mode
=============

While nu-mode is not a modal editor, and aims at being the most
efficient keymap, sometimes using lot of modifiers might still be
harassing.  Using vim keymap is feasible : you can activate evil-mode,
then switch from evil-state to emacs-state as you want.

   Even while in evil-state, you will enjoy a few nu-mode keys, like
Alt+v, Alt+f, and probably many others.  However vim paddle (hjkl for
left down up right) and nu-mode paddle (ijkl for up left down right)
disagree on three of these four keys!  If you want to have evil with
nu-mode paddle, I recommend you to make vim paddle similar to nu-mode.
Since <i> will not be available anymore to insert, use <h> for this
purpose.  Simply put below lines on your .emacs:

     (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "h") 'evil-insert)
     (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "j") 'evil-backward-char)
     (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "i") 'evil-previous-line)
     (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "k") 'evil-next-line)

   Obviously this only fixes the basic paddle.  Backward and Foward word
are different, but fixing the paddle is fine.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
